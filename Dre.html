<h2 id="Background">Background</h2>
<p>Dre Carter was born to Marissa Carter and her husband. When Dre was around four years old, his father disappeared from his life, leaving Marissa to raise him on her own for several years. As a result, Dre took on many responsibilities from a young age, often feeling the need to “man up” as soon as he was old enough.<br><br>
Dre met Ace in third grade, marking the beginning of an important friendship that would continue into his teenage years. When Dre was twelve, his younger sister Sylvia was born. Although his parents had already divorced by this point, Dre’s father later passed away when Dre was thirteen, permanently closing that chapter of his life.</p>

<p>When Dre was 14 years old, he met Avery, a classmate of his. They became boyfriend and girlfriend a bit after becoming friends, and they were quite close, until Dre started to notice Avery becoming distant when they were around 15 years old. Shortly after he turned 16, they broke up, due to him learning that Avery was being unfaithful to him.<br><br>
Dre became a magical boy one afternoon when he was taking a stroll and saw an alleyway. After a bit of exploring, he found a dirty and unconscious Tanpopo in the corner of the alley. He was going to pick it up, to take it home and clean it as a gift for Sylvia. But then Tanpopo woke up and chastised Dre for taking things that were not his. After which he was inducted into the Tanpopo Alliance as a magical boy.</p>
