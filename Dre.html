Sometimes, he can get quite defensive over those he cares about, not afraid to escalate things in defense<br><br>of his loved ones, in spite of his distaste for conflicts.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
    <h3>Early life</h3>
<p>Dre Carter was born to Marissa Carter and her husband. When Dre was around four years old, his father disappeared from his life, leaving Marissa to raise him on her own for several years. As a result, Dre took on many responsibilities from a young age, often feeling the need to “man up” as soon as he was old enough.<br><br>
Dre met Ace in third grade, marking the beginning of an important friendship that would continue into his teenage years. When Dre was twelve, his younger sister Sylvia was born. Although his parents had already divorced by this point, Dre’s father later passed away when Dre was thirteen, permanently closing that chapter of his life.</p>
